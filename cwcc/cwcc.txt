Usage: cwcc [OPTION]... [FILE]...
Print newline, word, and byte counts for each FILE, and a total line if
more than one FILE is specified. A word is a nonempty sequence of non white
space delimited by white space characters or by start or end of input.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
The options below may be used to select which counts are printed, always in
the following order: newline, word, character, byte, maximum line length.
  -c, --bytes            print the byte counts
  -m, --chars            print the character counts
  -l, --lines            print the newline counts
  -L, --max-line-length  print the maximum display width
  -w, --words            print the word counts
      --help             display this help and exit
